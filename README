This is the README file for the Supplementary Material of "A scalable method for the estimation of spatial downscaling models"

1) To reproduce the results, you must first run the script '0simulates.R', which will generate the simulated response variable.
Before running, make sure that your R installation has all the necessary packages installed.

2) Then, you must run the script '1parallel_ML.R', which contains the estimation method.
Before running, make sure to adjust the number of cores. The jobfile .sh is also provided.

3) The script '2predict_vcov.R' is optional. It generates the prediction rasters and the curves extracted by the model.
